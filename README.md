# CPU Performance Analyzer

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of CPU performance metrics, including CPU usage, RAM usage, cache metrics, thread performance, and power draw over a specified time duration. The `AdvancedCPUAnalyzer` class in this Python project enables users to collect, analyze, and generate a report on the system's performance.

## Features

- **Real-time CPU Usage**: Monitors CPU usage and calculates average and peak usage.
- **RAM Usage**: Monitors memory utilization during the analysis duration.
- **Cache Performance Simulation**: Simulates cache hierarchy performance with metrics for L1, L2, and L3 caches, including hits, misses, latency, and bandwidth.
- **Parallel Processing Analysis**: Measures parallel processing performance, speedup, efficiency, and thread imbalance.
- **Power and Thermal Metrics**: Reports on CPU temperature and power draw over the monitoring period.
- **Report Generation**: Generates a text report summarizing system performance metrics in detail.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**: Install the following libraries using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install psutil matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn
